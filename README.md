FINAL VERSION THESIS

The scripts and the 5000 IMDb Movie Dataset (movie_metadata.csv) are uploaded on this github. I have also included the used sentiment lexicon here. Furthermore, I put the pdf in this repository as well.

The actual dataset is apparently too big for github. Even when the dataset is divided in smaller parts and compressed in winrar archives. Therefore, I have included the link to the dataset: http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/

Note that in the feature analysis code, I sometimes use 'full' instead of 'train' or 'test'. On my machine, I have combined the train and test set together to create one 'full' dataset. Since I can't upload the dataset from my machine, this has to be done by hand. Simply copy and paste the two parts together and place them in a folder called 'full'. This folder should be in the same repository as the 'train' and 'test' folders.
